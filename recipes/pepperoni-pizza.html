    <h4>Steps</h4>
    
      <ol>
        <li>Mix 1 tbsp of active yeast to 1 cup of water and allow to foam.</li>
        <li>Once foamy, add 2 cups of flour and mix. Slowly pour in 2 tbsp each of olive oil<br>
        and melted butter as you mix. Set aside and allow dough to rise.</li>
        <li>Chop and slightly brown onions in pan. Added chopped garlic - salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Remove about 5-6 peeled tomatoes from can and put into blender. Add in onion mixture,<br>
             1 tbsp of basil, 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning, and a spoonful of tomato paste to thicken sauce.</li>
        <li>Carefully pulse blender. Not too much as it will make the sauce to thin.</li>
        <li>By this time, your dough should be risen. Go ahead and preheat the oven to 500 degrees.</li>
        <li>Press out dough to preference. I like to leave a thick crust.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has been pressed to your liking, spread your freshly made pizza sauce evenly onto dough.</li>
        <li>Spread mozzarella evenly on pizza.</li>
        <li>Add pepperonis on top of cheese. Once you've added your pepperonis, you're ready to stick it into the oven!</li>
        <li>Put pizza into oven at 500 degrees and allow to bake for 12 minuntes.</li>
        <li>Allow pizza to cool, cut into even slices, and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
